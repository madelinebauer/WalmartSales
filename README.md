## Predicting Future Walmart Sales
The purpose of this report is to identify machine learning models that will best predict future weekly store sales for 45 different Walmart stores that appear in the dataset. Walmart is a popular international company currently with 11,443 stores worldwide. Being able to predict weekly sales is a critical piece for retail companies as it can help determine how much inventory to purchase, how many people to have on staff, and improve overall decision making.

Models such as linear regression, K Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting were all developed as well as a time series approach with an ARIMA model.
